<h2>Su - super mode</h2>
<p>It's our really SUPER all-in-one solution to improve camera!</p>
<p>Can be used:</p>
<p>- in low light - resolution improvement, noise reduction, shadow recovery</p>
<p>- when bright back-light causes object of interest to be lost in shadows. Super Sensor recover automatically and noise-free</p>
<p>- scenes with beach and snow - automatic adjustment of typical auto-exposure failures (no user interaction!). What should be white is white now. Low-contrast details are not lost but enhanced. Miniature details revealed.</p>
<p>- Due to DR enhancement by up to 18db, high dynamic range scenes are handled well by Super Sensor.</p>
<p>- Super zoom - presenting a zoomed-in image from mobile device can be a frustrating experience. Not with Super Sensor.</p>
<p>- Perfect for documents: superior resolution and contrast maximisation. Always.</p>
