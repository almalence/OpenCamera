// in - captured frames in YUV format. in's should be allocated with malloc, these are free'd inside Hdr_Process
// caller should not free in buffers!
// Preview - (sx/4) x (sy/4) preview image in interleaved RGB888 format
// SensorGain is the sensor gain during capture, in u8.8 fixed-point format
// expoPref: 0=Normal, 1=Bright

// ctrstPref: 0=low 1=normal 2=high contrast
// microPref: 0=low 1=normal 2=high micro contrast
// colorPref, ctrstPref, microPref also accept fine grained values as -0..-100
// sx, sy: dimensions of input frames (width, height)
// alignmentLevel: 0=small displacements only, 1=correct large translations, 2=no alignment
// disableDeghosting: if set to 1 - use noise-free fusion instead of de-ghosting
// preFilter: set to 1 to apply noise filtering to input frames, set to 2 to have it more aggressive
// postFilter: set to 1 to apply post-filtering and possibly sharpening to the result
// scaleOutput: if set to 1 - output image will be up-scaled to input dimensions to
//    cover non-aligned edges, no in-place processing is possible in this case
//    (Out parameter to Hdr_Process() should be pre-allocated by caller)
// fastMode: 0=regular processing, 1=fast processing (recommended for >=8Mpix)
