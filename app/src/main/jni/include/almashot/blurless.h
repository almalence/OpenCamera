// BlurLess_Preview - call to construct preview
//
// instance - an address of a pointer to hold instance-related data, to be later passed to BlurLess_Process
// in - four or six captured frames in YUV format. in[0]-in[n] should be allocated with malloc
// Caller should allocate but should not free in[0]-in[n] buffers! (They are freed internally in BlurLess_Process)
// Preview - sx/4 x sy/4 preview image in interleaved RGB888 format
// SensorGain is the sensor gain during capture, in u8.8 fixed-point format
// DeGhostGain is used to adjust amount of de-ghosting, set to 256
// DeGhostFrame - number of frames to be used to get moving objects data, recommended: 1
// Mode:
//   0 - four input frames, with exposure adjustment, BE processing method 1
//   1 - six input frames with the same exposure, BE processing method 2
//   2 - six to ten input frames with the same exposure, BE processing method 3
// nFrames - number of input frames
// sx, sy: dimensions of input frames (width, height)
// preFilter - apply pre-filtering (useful for sensors with high noise)
// postFilter - apply luma and chroma post-filtering (soft-threshold median, sensor-gain and lens-shading dependent)
// zeroBlackLevel - do not subtract black level from the input frames
// enhanceLuma/enhanceChroma - amount of luma/chroma enhancement to apply (only in Mode 2), recommended value: 9
// 0 - no enhancement
// 1..10 - enhance (the higher the number the brighter or more colorful image output will be)
